you track time, manage schedules, and analyze time data.

## Pre-requisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- An internet connection
- Valid email address for account creation

Anyone can sign up for Temporal. To sign up, visit the Temporal website and click the **Sign Up** button. 
You can select between several sign up methods - choose one that is most convenient to you. 
Once you have signed up, you can log in to Temporal at any time.

If your email address is configured in any of existing workspaces, you will be immediately be able to log in to those workspaces.
If none workspaces are configured with your email address, you will be taken to the new workspace creation dialog.

## Create a Workspace

A workspace is a container for your data in Temporal. Workspace consists of members, teams, calendar entries and other data.

In order to create a workspace, you need to provide the following information:

- **Workspace name**. This is the name of your workspace. It can be anything you like. A common choice is the name of your company or team. You will be able to change it later.
- **Dataset**. Initial state of configurations in your workspace. It is highly recommended to create workspaces with *Basic* dataset which comes preconfigured with basic event categories and types. You will be able to start creating member events immediately after creating the workspace if *Basic* dataset is used.

### Demo Workspace

If you would like to explore what functionalities Temporal has to offer, you can choose *Demo* dataset for a workspace when creating it.
