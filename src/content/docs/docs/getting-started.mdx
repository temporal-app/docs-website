## Create a Workspace

A workspace is a container for your data in Temporal. Workspace consists of members, teams, calendar entries and other data.

In order to create a workspace, you need to provide the following information:

- **Workspace name**. Choose a name that reflects your company or team. Don't worry, you can change it later.
- **Dataset**. We recommend starting with the Basic dataset for a pre-configured experience.
